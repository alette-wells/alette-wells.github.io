This is where my blog posts will eventually go, instead of being on the homepage currently given by index.html. 

I think I will have to archive all of the posts to this page, and then hide them from the home page. Nevermind, there is a layout called 
```
posts
```
that simply archives/transfers over all your posts from the home page. Still need to figure out how to hide them from the home page.
