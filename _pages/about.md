This is a random page, and I want to see if it appears on tne navigation bar when I add it. 

Firstly, we are going to test whether headers and the auto-generated table of contents works for pages. 

# Why use headers

The above should produce an H1 heading, which draws the user's eye to section dilineation. 

## Drawing attention

Headers are good for this.

## Organizing content

Headers are good for this also.

# Why use tables of contents 

To help users navigate the page. 


Just checking \\(e^{i\pi} = -1\\).
We can also choose to put in a display equation. 
\\[e^{i\pi} = -1\\]
